This site is part of the [Polyring](https://polyring.ch), a webring connecting content created by members of ETH ZÃ¼rich.

As a current ETH student, I joined Polyring to connect with fellow students and alumni who share their projects, research, and random thoughts online. The ring currently has 30 members, ranging from personal blogs to technical project showcases.

### What's a Webring?

Before search engines and social media algorithms, webrings were how you discovered related content on the web. Sites would link to each other in a circular chain, allowing visitors to explore from one site to the next. It's a throwback to the 90s internet that's making a comeback as a way to build community outside of centralized platforms.
